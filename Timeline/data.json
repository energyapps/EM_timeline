The project utilized $12 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds and another $22 million in federal funds to complete work and close the site.<br /><br /> Pit 9 was a nuclear waste site in Idaho used by the Atomic Energy Commission starting in the late 1960s to dispose of uranium and plutonium waste from the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado. During that time in history, standard practices were for trucks loaded with barrels and boxes of plutonium waste to dump the waste into Pit 9 and other unlined or unmonitored holes in the ground. To get more space workers dropped large steel plates on the barrels to compress them, often-times releasing the long-lived, low radiation plutonium and americium directly into the soil. After several false starts and delays with prior cleanup efforts, EM renewed its work at Pit 9 in 2004.  At that time INL workers started removing waste from Pit 9 as a part of a demonstration project which dug up uranium and plutonium sludges, contaminated filters and other elements and repackaged the waste for proper disposal in safe, regulated and monitored disposal sites elsewhere.  Following successful demonstration the regulators approved the waste removal and cleanup plans and Pit 9 and four other similar areas have now be cleaned up. <br /><br />At left, (above) typical historical disposal practices in the 1960s; below  excavators dig up and remove buried waste which is sorted, characterized and segregated, and repackaged by hand in a glovebox. </div>",

      "text":"<div class='clsText'>In 2003, the first single-shell tank in C Farm was emptied. Removing solid waste (saltcake) from a single-shell tank is a challenging environmental restoration project. There are numerous physical restrictions including the fact that the tanks are buried underground beneath seven-to-10 feet of soil; have limited access via pipes that extend from the top of the tank to the ground surface; contain lethal radioactive and chemical waste, requiring all work to be performed remotely; and contain a variety of waste requiring multiple retrieval technologies. A tank is considered emptied (or retrieved) upon removal of as much of the liquid and solid waste as practical from each tank. The Hanford Tri-Party Agreement defines tank retrievals as “…retrieving as much tank waste as is possible. Tank waste residues shall not exceed 360 cubic feet in each of the large tanks, 30 cubic feet in each of the smaller tanks, or the limit of waste retrieval technology capability, whichever is less.” 360 cubic feet of residue in a large tank equates to about an inch of sludge if spread evenly over the bottom of the 530,000-gallon tank.<br /><br />At left, saltcake, or solid waste, that is left in each tank following interim stabilization (liquid removal) and before tank retrieval. </div>",

The excess coal is a result of the Paducah site’s switching from coal-powered boilers to five natural gas units to support site activities and heat offices during winter months. Switching to natural gas allowed Paducah to avoid costs associated with repairing and maintaining the 60-year-old steam plant and updating the facility to meet current environmental regulations. Further, the natural gas boilers are scalable, which means additional boilers can be added or removed as demand changes. <br /><br />At left, a front loader dumps a bucket of coal into the first of more than 700 trucks that will be used to transport coal from EM's Paducah Site to buyers.</div>",
